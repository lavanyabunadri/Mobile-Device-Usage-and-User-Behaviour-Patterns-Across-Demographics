# Mobile-Device-Usage-and-User-Behaviour-Patterns-Across-Demographics

This study explores mobile device usage patterns across diverse demographics, providing key
insights into how individuals engage with mobile technology. Analysing a dataset of variables
such as app usage time, screen-on time, battery consumption, data usage, age, and gender, the
findings reveal several important trends. Screen-on time steadily increases with age, with older
age groups demonstrating higher engagement than younger users, challenging traditional
assumptions about technology adoption. While gender differences in mobile usage were
minimal, males typically had a greater number of apps installed across most user behaviour
classes, and subtle variations were observed in data usage patterns. User behaviour classes
showed a strong correlation with metrics such as screen time, app diversity, and data usage,
with higher classes indicating greater engagement. Furthermore, Android remained the
dominant operating system across all demographics. These insights offer actionable
recommendations for developers and stakeholders aiming to optimize user experiences and
adapt to evolving trends in mobile behaviour.
